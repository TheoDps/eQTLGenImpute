## QC of imputed data

Here we compare the allele frequencies of imputed dataset to the EUR allele frequencies as reported in reference dataset.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 6, fig.align = "center"}
library(data.table)
# read in reference dataset AFs
# read in all AFs for target dataset
```
